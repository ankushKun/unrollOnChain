            "Body": "How does being vaccinated impact the risk of #LongCovid? \n\nA thread on 8 studies (I'll add to it as I find more):\n\n1/\n\n\n\n\nThe summary: vaccination definitely seems to reduce the risk of #LongCovid, often by 40-50%. \n\n*But* solidly 9.5%-14% of breakthroughs still result in Long Covid. \n\nThese figures make sense to me, given the estimated rate of LC in unvaccinated people (~10-30%).\n\n2/\n\n\n\n\nA caveat: many of these studied people who had been vaccinated relatively recently, so as always, we can expect these findings to change a bit as immunity wanes.\n\n3/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1: this is one of two studies rated as high quality by UKHSA. \n\n10,024 breakthrough cases with matched controls, looking 6 months from onset, found vaccination: \n\n\n\n4/\n\n\n\n\n-did not reduce overall #LongCovid risk, but did reduce risk of some key symptoms: fatigue, anosmia, hair loss, lung disease, myalgia\n-did not reduce risk for other symptoms: abdominal pain, headache\n-did reduce severe outcomes (hospitalization, death, respiratory failure)\n\n5/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 2: also rated high quality, this found a 7-10x reduced rate of #LongCovid!\n\nWhy the difference between Study 1? Not clear, but the number of breakthroughs was smaller (2400) here; it was also pre-Delta, where Study 1 included some Delta cases.\n\n\n\n6/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 3: \n\n3090 breakthroughs with controls (too new to be rated, but seems high quality) found a 41% decrease in #LongCovid risk.\n\nHowever, #LongCovid still happened in 9.5% of vaccinated participants compared to 14.6% of unvaccinated. Still high!\n\n\n\n7/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 4: 16035 breakthroughs \u0026amp; 3.57 million controls. Found vaccination had specific impacts:\n\n-Reduced risk in cardiovascular, coagulation, metabolic, pulmonary organ systems, \u0026amp; fatigue\n-Not reduced in kidney, gastrointestinal, neurologic systems\n\n \n\n8/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 5: \n\n366 breakthroughs and unvaccinated controls found 26.5% of fully vaccinated and 34.9% of unvaccinated had #LongCovid. \n\nAfter further analysis, they suggested that vaccination reduced the risk of Long Covid by 45%.\n\n\n\n9/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 6: \n\nApp-based study, 2370 breakthroughs with matched controls found that *full* vaccination reduced #LongCovid symptoms by roughly half. Notably, one dose resulted in the same Long Covid prevalence as unvaccinated controls.\n\n\n\n10/\n\n\n\n\nThe next 2 are weird or less comprehensive for different reasons. \n\n11/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 7: \n\nThis one included a) uninfected controls \u0026amp; b) unvaccinated infected controls, along with vaccinated infected. Some false negatives or sick people were likely in the uninfected controls, because they had high baseline symptom rates (recruited from PCR test sites). \n\n12/\n\n\n\n\nComparing unvaccinated to vaccinated, this study found some reductions in some symptoms, but not consistently across age groups.\n\n-No reduction in loss of concentration, persistent cough, overall recovery \n\n13/\n\n\n\n\n-Did reduce fatigue, headache, weakness, myalgia, hair loss, dizziness \u0026amp; shortness of breath\n-Most reductions higher in people \u0026gt;60 than age 19-35\n-11% of vaccinated had fatigue vs 26% unvaccinated\n-14% of vaccinated had headache vs 22% unvaccinated\n\n \n\n14/\n\n\n\n\nStudy 8: this one *only* looked at the effect of vaccination on olfactory dysfunction.\n\nThey found vaccination was protective against olfactory dysfunction between 14-88 days after the final dose, but began to wane after that. #LongCovid\n\n\n\n15/\n\n\n\n\nIn summary: get vaccinated to reduce your risk of #LongCovid, but be aware that if you get a breakthrough, the risk is still high!\n\n16/\n\n\n\n\nThese findings might also suggest reductions in certain types of #LongCovid (respiratory and possibly cardiovascular stick out to me) but not to others (neurologic and gastrointestinal in particular). \n\n17/",

            "Body": "What are some popular architectures that are suitable for Flutter App Development (and which one to choose)?\n\nIt boils down to what level of complexity you need to handle. 👇\n\nThread. 🧵 \n\n\n\n\n(1/2) Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern made of 3 types of components:\n\n- Model: directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application\n- View: UI components (widgets)\n- Controller: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view \n\n\n\n\n(2/2) MVC typically overloads the model with too much logic, and an additional service layer is often added: MVC+S\n\nThe Model should be reactive (e.g. using ChangeNotifier) so that the widgets rebuild when the model changes.\n\nAnd user inputs always go through the controller.\n\n\n\n\n(1/2) Model-view-viewmodel is also a design pattern made of 3 components:\n\n- Model: directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application\n- View: UI components (widgets)\n- ViewModel: mediates between the view and the model. \n\n\n\n\n(2/2) The View and the ViewModel are connected with a data-binding based on the observer pattern.\n\nWhen usign MVVM, the view can't access the model directly.\n\nRather, the ViewModel handles user inputs and converts the data from the Model so it can be easily presented.\n\n\n\n\nClean Architecture takes separation of concerns to the next level.\n\nIt is quite complex, requiring a bigger learning curve and considerably more boilerplate.\n\nSome people swear by it and say it's worthwhile for large codebases:\n\nMore info here:\n\n\n\n\n\n(1/2) Bloc Architecture is an architectural pattern built on top of the flutter_bloc package:\n\nIt allows us to separate our application into three layers:\n\n- Presentation (widgets)\n- Business Logic (blocs)\n- Data (Repository \u0026amp; Data Provider)\n\n\n\n\n(2/2) It is a very opinionated architecture that uses streams to communicate between widgets and blocs (and between blocs themselves).\n\nIt's used by many teams and is very well documented - but sometimes criticised for requiring too much boilerplate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1/2) Stacked is a package + architecture that began as a MVVM implementation for Flutter.\n\n- View: Shows the UI to the user.\n- ViewModel: Manages the View state, business logic, and logic to handle user interaction\n- Services: similar to the data layer in other architectures\n\n\n\n\n(2/2) Stacked provides a base architecture and an extensive set of useful widgets that make your life easier so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, which architecture should you choose?\n\nTurns out, this is not as important as defining clear contracts and boundaries in your app.\n\nI really like this quote from the eBay engineering blog:  \n\n\n\n\nIn practice, for small and medium-sized apps, most of the architectures above provide a good starting point.\n\nAnd they're certainly better than having no architecture at all.\n\nSo pick one and try it out. Maybe your code won't be great on the first try, but that's ok.\n\n\n\n\nNeed more guidance?\n\nOver the last few months, I built a complete eCommerce app applying many techniques from Domain-Driven Design and trying out various design patterns.\n\nI ended up with a Riverpod-based architecture that uses 4 layers with clear boundaries: \n\n\n\n\nI came away with many valuable insights about how to use DDD, app architecture, state management, testing, and much more in real world apps.\n\nAnd I'll be sharing them in my upcoming course.\n\nSign up here to get a big discount when I open the pre-sale:\n\n",

            "Body": "Ramzan is approaching and we need to talk: a thread 🧵\n\n\n\n\nThis Ramzan, normalise eating in public for those who aren’t fasting. \n\nDon’t stare at them\nDon’t ask them aap roza nhe rakhtay?\nDon’t say mera roza hay don’t eat infront of me\n\n\n\n\nIt is understandable that restaurants are closed during the day because its a business decision. I don’t like it but fine, it makes economic sense. There aren’t MANY customers.\n\nWhat doesn’t make sense to me is that why eating in public during the day is a taboo.\n\n\n\n\nIsn’t fasting supposed to teach you control and patience and sabar? What has it taught you if you can’t control yourself at the sight of food?\n\nAap ke samnay koi kha raha ho and ap na khain, THAT is real control.\n\n\n\n\nAt any given day, there is a significant part of the population that isn’t fasting. I will list these below. Not allowing to eat in public affects all of them.\n\nThe list contains but is not restricted to:\n\n\n\n\n1) Children\n2) Elderly\n3) Sick\n4) Travellers\n5) Menstruating women\n6) Pregnant or breastfeeding women\n7) People with hard jobs i.e labourers\n8) Non-Muslims (including closeted atheists who may look like they are fasting but they aren’t)\n9) many non-practicing muslims themselves\n\n\n\n\nI haven’t come across a single verse or hadith that prohibits eating publicly in Ramzan. Its not prohibited!\n\n\n\n\nRamzan Mubarak!",
